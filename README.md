Personal Blog Application
Description
This is a simple personal blog application where users can create and view blog posts. Users can enter their username, the blog post title, and content through a form. The submitted data is saved to localStorage, and all stored blog posts are displayed on a separate page with a dark mode toggle option. The blog also features basic validation to ensure all form fields are filled out before submission. This project helps practice JavaScript DOM manipulation, localStorage usage, and handling light/dark themes.

Features
A form to create blog posts, requiring username, title, and content.
Data validation to ensure no fields are left empty.
Blog posts are saved to localStorage for persistent data storage.
A separate page to view all blog posts stored in localStorage.
Light mode/dark mode toggle that persists between page reloads.

To modify or further develop, open the project in your preferred code editor (such as VSCode).
